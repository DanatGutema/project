  "description": "Med track is a web application that is used for pregnant mothers in order to track the health and development of a child. \r Mainly this application will create a connection between mothers and doctors for those who cannot frequently go to the hospital\r because of so many reasons including lack of transportation. The working of the application is pretty easy and doesnâ€™t need any extra knowledge in software things. \r If pregnant women go to the hospital, by using this application they can do registration work and can get all services from their phone for the next consecutive months.\r The main services include giving advice for each and particular month of pregnancy, remembering appointment dates, and gating urgent help from their doctor \r if necessary, through calls or video, to get a prescription. This application can help people who cannot remember their appointment date and do not know what kinds of\r care should be taken during pregnancy too. In addition to this, there is a card called the MCP card (mother and child protection card) which can be used as a\r counseling tool, for tracking mother and child, and for educating them about health, nutrition, and child development. This useful card is given to mothers as hardcopy.\r That can be easily damage or lose. In order to solve this, we have given access to get their MCP card in our portal for mothers at any time. To build the application\r we are using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, and FIREBASE.",
